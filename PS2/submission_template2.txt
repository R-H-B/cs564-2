        PROBLEM SET 2 SUBMISSION TEMPLATE

        Please copy and paste your SQL queries (and potentially Python and Latex code) 
	into the appropriate spots below. 

        When submitting SQL queries, please do not include the intitial 
        %sql or %%sql IPython commands. Just include the SQL code.

        DO NOT DELETE THE <![CDATA[ ... ]]> LINES IN EACH <answer> TAG!
        Doing so will break the autograder. To avoid accidentally breaking

answer = True
explanation = "Because, based on the Closure Algorithm, A's closure is {A,D,E,C,F}. Then, based on ARMSTRONG’S AXIOMS 2, the closure of {A,B} is {A,B,C,D,E,F}, which is thet set of all attributes."

answer = False
explanation = "Becuase the final result based on Chase Algorithm is: row 1: A, B, C, D1, E, F; row 2: A2, B2, C, D, E, F2; row 3: A, B3, C, D1, E, F. and since all FDs are satisfied, the Chase Algorithm terminates. However, there does not exist a row with all data without a subscription. Therefore, it is not lossless-join."

answer = False
explanation = "Because the FDs of ABC is: {A} -> {C}; the FDs of CDE is: {D} -> {C}; the FDs of EFA is {A} -> {E, F}. After enforcing the FDs of each of these subrelations, we cannot logically imply the FD: {A} -> {D} and FD: {D} -> {F} from relation S any more. Thus, it is not dependency preserving."

answer = False
explanation = "Bacause {A} -> {D} is a non-trivial FD of S. However, {A} is not a superkey, since the closure of {A}, which is {A,D,E,C,F} from the Closure Algorithm, does not contain B. Therefore, the definition of BCNF is violated."
