Some extra tests:

test4_boundTest_Random()
– Added test which creates key-value pairs from 0 to relationSize which is defaulted to be 5000 in the random order.
– Test if the output amount matches the input amount when scanning.
– This test finds keys that are out of the range of input.

• test5_boundTest_Forward()
– Added test which creates key-value pairs from 0 to relationSize which is defaulted to be 5000 in the Forward order.
– Test if the output amount matches the input amount when scanning.
– This test finds keys that are out of the range of input.

• test6_boundTest_Backward()
– Added test which creates key-value pairs from 0 to relationSize which is defaulted to be 5000 in the Backward order.
– Test if the output amount matches the input amount when scanning.
– This test finds keys that are out of the range of input.

• test7_int_CreateMoreRelation_Forward()
– Added test which creates key-value pairs from 0 to a larger relationSize in the Forward order.
– The relationSize is set to be 200000 to test splitting on non-leaf node.
– Test if the output amount matches the input amount when scanning.

• test8_int_CreateMoreRelation_Backward()
– Added test which creates key-value pairs from 0 to a larger relationSize in the Backward order.
– The relationSize is set to be 200000 to test splitting on non-leaf node.
– Test if the output amount matches the input amount when scanning.

• test9_int_CreateMoreRelation Random()
– Added test which creates key-value pairs from 0 to a larger relationSize in the Random order.
– The relationSize is set to be 200000 to test splitting on non-leaf node.
– Test if the output amount matches the input amount when scanning.

All the extra tests are in the main.cpp file.
